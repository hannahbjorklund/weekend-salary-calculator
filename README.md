# Project Name

Employee Salary Calculator

## Description

This project allows the user to enter employee information. The employee info is added to a table of employees, and a total monthly expense is calculated from all their annual salaries. The user has the option to delete employee entries as well. The total expense will turn red if it is over budget.
